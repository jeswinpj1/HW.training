  "description": "Prior to getting my real estate license 31 years ago, I was a classical pianist and music teacher. Today, I accredit my success as an agent in many ways to the time I have spent in the practice room with my students. Attention in the preparation of a recital makes you aware of hitting important details. This has carried over into my real estate business and the way I love to help my clients. It is the fine-tuning and attention to detail that means so much to the customer. Many of my music students went on to become doctors, lawyers, and do things where that fine-tuning is critical.",

In 2011 she moved to the gulf coast and continued her Real Estate career in Destin, FL for a few years before returning to her home town of Clanton, AL in 2016. This has given her several years of experience within her home state of Alabama as well as the bustling tourist destinations in Northern Florida. To her, being a REALTOR® means more than selling homes. It's about you, your hopes and your dreams. She builds relationships based on trust, knowledge and expertise.

  "description": "Cecil has been selling real estate for more than 20 years. She is a native of Birmingham, growing up in Mountain Brook, and she is a third generation resident of Forest Park. Prior to her career in real estate, Cecil worked as a set decorator in New York for many years before her return to Birmingham. Her passion for architecture, design, and detail are what led her to pursue real estate. When not selling houses, you will likely find Cecil advocating for local green spaces, participating in equestrian adventures, gardening, caring for family, or pursuing her latest renovation project. Cecil has an eye for detail and strong organizational skills. She brings honesty and integrity to every transaction. She enjoys helping people. If you are looking to buy or sell in Birmingham, Cecil would be honored to help you. \"Your home is most important. It's an investment. It should also be your refuge\"",

Before my career in real estate, I spent over 30 years in the teaching profession, caring for and educating countless young minds. I believe every moment of life is a precious gift from God, and I try to approach each day with a sense of gratitude, always seeking to intentionally celebrate that gift in some way every single day.",

Hayden honed his marketing skills and strategies in the midst of one of the worst real estate markets in decades, during the fallout after the massive housing bubble and ensuing market crash in 2008. He has consistently been a top producer since 2010, and he's been fortunate enough to represent hundreds of buyers and sellers throughout the Birmingham area. Hayden has sold well over $175 million in real estate and was awarded the Top 30 under 30 for real estate from the Birmingham Business Journal.",

  "description": "With over 45 years of experience in real estate, I have always strived to be the trusted source of knowledge and support to my clients and my agents. Originally licensed in 1978, I started out as an agent selling real estate until I became a broker in 1985. At that time, I was with Wood Realty who merged with First Real Estate who then merged with RealtySouth. I have been a broker for the western side of Birmingham, from Five Points West to Hueytown and now in McCalla. My focus has always been to provide my knowledge, experience, and support for our agents so they can in turn provide the best of all of us to their clients.",

I grew up in Crestwood, went to college at the University of Alabama and my first career was a Buyer for the infamous Parisian. I traveled all over the world developing and designing private label merchandise. Parisian taught me \"the customer is always right\". This helps me to establish professional work ethics and to always treat people the way I would want to be treated. After 11 wonderful years with Parisian, I became a full time Mom for 18 years. The joy of my life.",
