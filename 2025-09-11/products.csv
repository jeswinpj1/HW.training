And for this classic crew neck, we've partnered with artisans in a family-run factory in Northern Italy where they dye, spin and knit our cashmere to give you a true taste of luxury. Knitted in a mid-weight gauge with a ribbed knit neck, hem and cuffs, this jumper is an all-season all-star that's even machine washable. A luxurious layer to dress up or down. Specialist cashmere spinners in Italy use their extensive expertise to twist a finer, softer, more rounded yarn, giving a deeper colour when dyed. We blend three to four different hues to make just one colour, ensuring each shade has a richness to it. Our own-brand cashmere story starts on the other side of the world, in the region stretching from northern China into Mongolia, where goats survive the harsh winter by growing an extra-fine coat underneath their weather-resistant guard hair — this is where the cashmere comes from. The cold climate and hearty lifestyle of the animals produce the longest, finest, softest fibres: some of the best cashmere in the world. Our own-brand men's cashmere is 100% Sustainable Fibre Alliance certified.","['Colour:', 'Black']","['Product code:', '37562816']",2025-09-11 12:15:24.091

Well for starters, it's loved for its industrial aesthetic and strong welded iron details, which have a wire-brushed and distressed finish. But it's also loved for its natural charm. Individual slats of solid oak make up the rustic surfaces which have been thoughtfully chosen by skilled craftspeople. They ensure that the natural pattern of the wood grain, even with its unique irregularities, uphold the design and quality standards that we're known for. This ensures our Calia range offers a look that's as authentic as possible. Easy on the eye and great just the right size. This dining table has space for six seats. It's incredibly sturdy and quick to assemble. Oak is a natural, living material, and part of its charm is that it develops over time. This means that surface splits may start to appear with the natural movement of the wood. Knots will vary in size and location and a subtle colour variation can also be expected. These distinctive qualities give the range a unique feel, as no two pieces will be exactly the same. To keep your furniture looking its best, we recommend periodic oiling and oiling before first use. More information can be found in the assembly instructions supplied. You may want to see and get a feel for the furniture in one of our shops before ordering.

Face: Use on cheekbones and brow bones to highlight your features for a natural sculpting effect. This product is not a concealer, it brings light to the skin.

The Super Restorative range is ideal for all women experiencing the effects of hormonal changes associated with menopause and has been formulated to support the skin during this stage of a woman's life. The skin is a hormone-dependent organ and the changes in hormones during peri and the start of post-menopause result in the skin becoming unbalanced. This disruption means that the skin struggles to protect itself during the day as well as reactivate itself at night. This can result in signs of ageing becoming more visible. The nourishing and revitalising formulas of Super Restorative help to fight visible changes on the skin which include dryness, skin slackening, loss of density, deep-set wrinkles, and an uneven skin tone. New research has led to Clarins’ discovery of organic harungana which has intensive replenishment and anti-ageing benefits and offers the same effect as retinol whilst being tolerated by all skin types. Organic harungana is combined with our new plant discovery, organic gorse extract, which helps improve the tone of fibroblasts by up to 89% and provides a firmer, more toned skin alongside other ingredients such as organic desert date extract, organic sea lily and vitamin C derivative. Each of the Super Restorative Day & Night creams is formulated to adapt to the skin’s chronobiology. During the day, the skin is vulnerable and needs protection and the squalane extract found in our day formulas reinforces the hydrolipidic film and protects the skin. At night, the skin needs reactivating as microcirculation slows. Organic service tree bud extract helps to stimulate the skin's microcirculation and boosts radiance. This innovative day and night duo ensure the skin's specific needs are met around the clock. The Night Cream for All Skin Types boosts the skin’s radiance thanks to the service tree bud extract.",[''],"['Product code:', '46211914']",2025-09-11 13:05:32.990

Using protective leather gels and/or sprays such as Collinil Leather Gel will help to improve the water resistance of certain leathers and can help leather resist dirt and moisture. Use whenever you feel the leather needs a bit of a refresh or a just little more shine. Try to keep leather away from water and out of heavy rainfall. If it does get wet, remove any residual water immediately with paper towels, pack loosely with paper and allow the leather to dry naturally. Likewise, try to avoid keeping your product in direct heat or sunlight for prolonged periods of time as it may cause the colour to fade unevenly and unnecessarily. Marks may appear naturally on the leather surface with age and the finish may start to dull. This is a common property of leather and is just a sign of a well-loved product and its unique characteristics. Superficial marks can often be rubbed carefully with a soft cloth. Please refer to the recommended care products for further advice on surface protection. Darker-coloured leathers can transfer colour onto lighter-coloured fabrics and mark it. Dark-coloured fabric dyes (such as denim) can also transfer onto lighter-coloured leathers. Colour transfer in this way is not covered under the Mulberry Care Policy. Take extra care using products with dark-coloured suede or fabric lining, as these materials can cause the colour to transfer to lighter-coloured fabrics or objects.","['Colour:', 'Linen Green/Khaki']","['Product code:', '40591119']",2025-09-11 13:18:09.073

The new edge-to-edge 4.1-inch Infinity Cover Screen not only looks incredible, but also comes with Galaxy AI[1] and Google Gemini[2]. Ask questions, set appointments and reminders, all before unfolding the handset to reveal the massive 6.9-inch screen. Now backed with 4,300mAh[3] of battery power. Get the ultra-selfie experience with 50MP rear camera and the Next Gen ProVisual Engine for the best shots any time of day. Edit your selfie with your custom filters straight from your Infinity FlexWindow and let the intuitive Galaxy AI features like Best Face[4] and Photo Assist[1] make your pictures social feed-worthy. Galaxy Z Flip7 is the thinnest, yet most durable, Galaxy Z Flip device to date. Its Infinity FlexWindow keeps you in the loop – even when the phone is closed – featuring a 70% slimmer bezel than its predecessor. When the task in hand demands a bigger screen, just flip Galaxy Z Flip7 open to reveal its huge 6.9-inch display with a cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio, making everything from messaging to streaming feel larger than life. The new build is super light and super slim, measuring just 6.5mm – about the same width as a pencil. It’s more robust than ever too, with a strengthened Dual Rail Hinge made of Advanced Armour Aluminium and IP48[5]-rated protection. Built to stand up to daily wear and tear, from light bumps to minor spills. Supercharge your selfie game with Galaxy Z Flip7’s 50MP camera. Activate Flex Mode[6] to get creative, and capture photos from new angles, no tripod required. And if the final shot is a little unbalanced, AutoZoom[7] will reframe the shot on its own, getting rid of any negative space and putting you front and centre. When it’s time for a big group photo, Best Face[8] makes sure everyone always looks their best. It takes multiple pics of the same composition in a quick burst, so if someone has their eyes closed, you can instantly swap it to a better facial expression. But editing and refining your best shots doesn’t end there. Photo Assist[9] lets you resize, remove, and retouch, so you can give every shot your signature look and feel. And for further personalisation, you can repurpose filters you’ve found online or even create your own. So, your next post is uniquely you. Are you ready for a new way to interact with AI? Chat with Google Gemini[2] even when Galaxy Z Flip7 is closed as the new edge-to-edge FlexWindow unlocks more ways to get more things done. Need a last-minute dinner reservation, that has to be nearby, Italian and pet-friendly? Just Ask Gemini on FlexWindow – job done instantly. Need to show Gemini what’s right in front of you? Just turn on the camera and start asking questions – whether you are on the FlexWindow, propped up, or fully unfolded. Or you can share your screen and ask for outfit inspiration based on the cool jacket you’ve just seen on your socials. Whether your phone is open or closed, you can stay on top of your full day. With the Galaxy AI-powered Now Bar[1], you’ll know when to leave for that important lunch meeting, how far away your Uber is, and what time your cinema date starts at a glance. And you can stay organised and informed with Now Brief[1], offering a full insight into your day to day. True AI companionship, ready for whatever the day brings. Galaxy Z Flip7 is the fastest, smoothest Flip to date. It may be small in your pocket, but it’s big on power and performance. A new Exynos 2500 keeps everything running smoothly, so demanding tasks like immersive gaming and 4K movie streaming aren’t interrupted or slowed down. The powerful processor is joined by a huge 4,300mAh[3] battery, easily able to power through whatever you’re doing and still have plenty of charge to keep going.

A popper-adjusted gusset increases the volume, and the leather handles can be shortened or lengthened as desired. Finished with one internal slip pocket. To ensure you get the most out of your leather product, Mulberry recommends regular care and maintenance. Using protective leather gels and/or sprays such as Collinil Leather Gel will help to improve the water resistance of certain leathers and can help leather resist dirt and moisture. Use whenever you feel the leather needs a bit of a refresh or a just little more shine. Try to keep leather away from water and out of heavy rainfall. If it does get wet, remove any residual water immediately with paper towels, pack loosely with paper and allow the leather to dry naturally. Likewise, try to avoid keeping your product in direct heat or sunlight for prolonged periods of time as it may cause the colour to fade unevenly and unnecessarily. Marks may appear naturally on the leather surface with age and the finish may start to dull. This is a common property of leather and is just a sign of a well-loved product and its unique characteristics. Superficial marks can often be rubbed carefully with a soft cloth. Please refer to the recommended care products for further advice on surface protection. Darker-coloured leathers can transfer colour onto lighter-coloured fabrics and mark it. Dark-coloured fabric dyes (such as denim) can also transfer onto lighter-coloured leathers. Colour transfer in this way is not covered under the Mulberry Care Policy. Take extra care using products with dark-coloured suede or fabric lining, as these materials can cause the colour to transfer to lighter-coloured fabrics or objects.","['Colour:', 'Black']","['Product code:', '40591118']",2025-09-11 14:02:12.880

Designed with two internal card slip pockets and one detachable chain strap with leather detail. To ensure you get the most out of your leather product, Mulberry recommends regular care and maintenance. Using protective leather gels and/or sprays such as Collinil Leather Gel will help to improve the water resistance of certain leathers and can help leather resist dirt and moisture. Use whenever you feel the leather needs a bit of a refresh or a just little more shine. Try to keep leather away from water and out of heavy rainfall. If it does get wet, remove any residual water immediately with paper towels, pack loosely with paper and allow the leather to dry naturally. Likewise, try to avoid keeping your product in direct heat or sunlight for prolonged periods of time as it may cause the colour to fade unevenly and unnecessarily. Marks may appear naturally on the leather surface with age and the finish may start to dull. This is a common property of leather and is just a sign of a well-loved product and its unique characteristics. Superficial marks can often be rubbed carefully with a soft cloth. Please refer to the recommended care products for further advice on surface protection. Darker-coloured leathers can transfer colour onto lighter-coloured fabrics and mark it. Dark-coloured fabric dyes (such as denim) can also transfer onto lighter-coloured leathers. Colour transfer in this way is not covered under the Mulberry Care Policy. Take extra care using products with dark-coloured suede or fabric lining, as these materials can cause the colour to transfer to lighter-coloured fabrics or objects.","['Colour:', 'Black']","['Product code:', '40591112']",2025-09-11 14:06:16.310

A popper-adjusted gusset increases the volume, and the leather handles can be shortened or lengthened as desired. Finished with one internal slip pocket. To ensure you get the most out of your leather product, Mulberry recommends regular care and maintenance. Using protective leather gels and/or sprays such as Collinil Leather Gel will help to improve the water resistance of certain leathers and can help leather resist dirt and moisture. Use whenever you feel the leather needs a bit of a refresh or a just little more shine. Try to keep leather away from water and out of heavy rainfall. If it does get wet, remove any residual water immediately with paper towels, pack loosely with paper and allow the leather to dry naturally. Likewise, try to avoid keeping your product in direct heat or sunlight for prolonged periods of time as it may cause the colour to fade unevenly and unnecessarily. Marks may appear naturally on the leather surface with age and the finish may start to dull. This is a common property of leather and is just a sign of a well-loved product and its unique characteristics. Superficial marks can often be rubbed carefully with a soft cloth. Please refer to the recommended care products for further advice on surface protection. Darker-coloured leathers can transfer colour onto lighter-coloured fabrics and mark it. Dark-coloured fabric dyes (such as denim) can also transfer onto lighter-coloured leathers. Colour transfer in this way is not covered under the Mulberry Care Policy. Take extra care using products with dark-coloured suede or fabric lining, as these materials can cause the colour to transfer to lighter-coloured fabrics or objects.","['Colour:', 'Black']","['Product code:', '40591118']",2025-09-11 14:14:48.367

To ensure you get the most out of your leather product, Mulberry recommends regular care and maintenance. Using protective leather gels and/or sprays such as Collinil Leather Gel will help to improve the water resistance of certain leathers and can help leather resist dirt and moisture. Use whenever you feel the leather needs a bit of a refresh or a just little more shine. Try to keep leather away from water and out of heavy rainfall. If it does get wet, remove any residual water immediately with paper towels, pack loosely with paper and allow the leather to dry naturally. Likewise, try to avoid keeping your product in direct heat or sunlight for prolonged periods of time as it may cause the colour to fade unevenly and unnecessarily. Marks may appear naturally on the leather surface with age and the finish may start to dull. This is a common property of leather and is just a sign of a well-loved product and its unique characteristics. Superficial marks can often be rubbed carefully with a soft cloth. Please refer to the recommended care products for further advice on surface protection. Darker-coloured leathers can transfer colour onto lighter-coloured fabrics and mark it. Dark-coloured fabric dyes (such as denim) can also transfer onto lighter-coloured leathers. Colour transfer in this way is not covered under the Mulberry Care Policy. Take extra care using products with dark-coloured suede or fabric lining, as these materials can cause the colour to transfer to lighter-coloured fabrics or objects.","['Colour:', 'Black']","['Product code:', '40591122']",2025-09-11 14:17:12.915

This powerhouse can do everything a leading flagship phone does when closed – and even more when unfolded – with an immersive 8-inch display that’s perfect for binge watching your favourite shows and crushing high scores in your favourite game. There’s also plenty of room to test out Galaxy AI[1] and Google Gemini[2]. Now optimised for the large screen with One UI 8.0, multi-tasking is even more seamless with minimal on-screen interruption. The flagship 200MP camera has the same pixel count as Galaxy S25 Ultra, guaranteeing pixel-perfect quality in every shot. It’s joined by a new 12MP ultra-wide camera with autofocus, enabling macro photography revealing a world unseen by the naked eye. And when you want to capture something in distance, use the 10MP 3x optical zoom camera to get closer without losing clarity. Galaxy Z Fold7’s thinness makes no compromise on performance, with its 4,400mAh[3] battery for long-lasting action. And to make sure everything runs at full speed, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor takes performance to the next level. The latest Galaxy Z Fold7 is thinner, lighter and more pocket-friendly than ever before, measuring just 4.2mm when unfolded and weighing only 215g – less than an average large bar of chocolate. The Cover Screen now measures 6.5-inches from corner to corner and with the new 21:9 aspect ratio, typing is more comfortable andnatural compared to its predecessor. Yet, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real magic starts when Galaxy Z Fold7 is unfolded, revealing the truly cinematic 8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X Infinity Flex Display. The expansive screen promises an epic entertainment experience, whether you’re a gamer, film fanatic, or a bit of both. And to protect everything from the odd bump, scrape and scratch, it’s built with Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2[4], Advanced Armour Aluminium[5] , and certified as IP48[6], for water and dust defence. Galaxy Z Fold7 is outstanding inside and out, with its striking design, game-changing display and incredible camera. The three lenses are made up of a 200MP sensor for exceptional quality in every shot – four-times sharper than its predecessor. A new 12MP ultra-wide lens with autofocus for macro photography revealing stunning beauty in the tiniest of details. And a 10MP 3x zoom lens, getting you closer to the action without losing quality. The hardware is joined by Next Gen ProVisual Engine[7], which improves Nightography and portraits. True-to-life skin tones are more accurately captured too, highlighting subtle details, even in poorly lit conditions. Galaxy AI-powered Photo Assist[8] makes all your edits and post-productions jobs easy, letting you personalise your masterpieces like a pro. And when it comes to taking video calls with the office, or snapping a cheeky group selfie, there’s a new powerful 10MP front-facing, wider angle lens, making sure you always look your best. Galaxy Z Fold7’s iconic looks are one thing, but it’s nothing short of ultra-powerful on the inside, with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor for Galaxy at its beating heart. All that muscle allows AI to gallop at full speed and keeps games running smoothly – with enhanced ray tracing – mimicking real-world shadows and reflections for super immersive gameplay on the huge display. And to make sure gaming marathons aren’t interrupted, there’s a huge 4,400mAh[3] battery under the hood too – despite the phone’s slim design – keeping you powered up. Galaxy AI[1] and Google Gemini[2] are more helpful and more attuned to your needs. Need step-by- step guidance for your favourite recipe? Just ask Gemini. Unsure which washing cycle your new jumper should go on or want key takeaways from a travel vlog? Share your camera or screen in conversations with Gemini Live so that it can see what you see in real time. Always just a few taps away. Galaxy Z Fold7’s large screen is fully optimised with One UI 8.0, giving you plenty of room to test out Gemini’s AI strengths – without obstructing your view – making multitasking a breeze. Staying on top of your day-to-day schedule is easy, even when the phone is folded shut, thanks to Galaxy AI’s Now Brief[1] and Now Bar[1] all from the Cover Screen. See upcoming events, sports fixtures and results, and personal appointments at a glance – without opening multiple apps – all powered by Galaxy AI[1] and completely tailored to your needs.

As well as getting your laundry spotless, ecobubble™ Technology helps save energy by washing effectively at lower temperatures, plus SmartThings™ will proactively help you manage your laundry and monitor energy usage. Enjoy a simple way to wash and dry. The 7” wide LCD display acts as an intuitive control centre for managing your laundry. So you can quickly select functions and adjust settings. It personalises your washing and drying by remembering your habits and suggesting cycles based on machine learning. And, after washing, it provides an energy and water consumption report through the SmartThings App (available on Android and iOS devices. A Wi-Fi connection and a Samsung account are required). Control your washing machine easily with just your voice. Using the Samsung Bixby voice recognition assistant, you can simply say what you want it to do and it will do it. So, even if your hands are full, you can select cycle options, control the settings during a cycle, set optional functions and monitor the progress of your wash cycle. And, if you find it difficult to read the screen, it can provide spoken feedback about the information shown. (A Samsung account log-in and data network connection (Wi-Fi or data network) are required. Selected languages only) Wash clothes using less energy. The Samsung washing machine is highly energy efficient and even exceeds the minimum energy efficiency requirements for the A Grade rating by up to 55%*.

The energy consumption of this 9KG model is 21.8kWh / 100 cycles, which is 55% more energy efficient compared to the minimum threshold of energy efficiency class A (52kWh / 100 cycles for 9KG models). Energy ratings tested with Eco 40-60 program, 55% savings tested with Eco 40-60 program. Mealtime mess or grass stains? Whether it's cotton, synthetics or baby clothes, add a 30-minute bubble soak to your wash. Then let our unique ecobubble™ technology go deep into the fabrics to loosen stubborn stains. You'll love how brilliant it gets your whites. Help to reduce the amount of harmful plastic microfibres that are released into the ocean every year. The Less Microfiber™ Filter captures up to 98% of micro plastics* released when washing laundry to prevent them from being discharged into the sewage, where they cannot be removed by the normal water purification plant filtering system. *Confirmed by internal testing measuring weight of micro plastics in the waste water vs with filter. Here’s a quiet washing machine that’s built to last, has all the power you need and cuts down on noise. It’s all thanks to Samsung's Digital Inverter Technology ramping up the performance, not the noise. And the added bonus? The components and engineering are backed by a 20-year warranty, giving you peace of mind for years to come. Looking for the cleanest clothes? It all starts with a sparkling washing machine. Drum Clean keeps the inside of your washer hygienically clean with a combination of soaking, pulsating and high-speed spinning that removes 99.9% of odour-causing bacteria* from the drum, without using any detergents. And it even reminds you after 40 washes to run a cleaning cycle. The best news? Good maintenance will save you some money in the long run. *Eliminates 99.9% of bacteria from the inside of the washing machine and removes dirt from the rubber gasket. Based on testing by Intertek of the Drum Clean cycle. When it comes to deep-down cleaning, not all washing machines are up to the job. So it’s good to know that Hygiene Steam on your Samsung washing machine banishes the things you can see and those you can’t – bacteria, pollen, dust mites and more. The steam is released upwards to make sure every last item gets a deep and even clean. The results? 99.9% of bacteria are obliterated and allergens inactivated*. No pre-soaking, no hassle, no worries. *Testing done by Intertek on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and Dermatophagoides farinae Hughes, on 100% cotton, 3kg load, with standard powder detergent.

As the blackout lining on these curtains blocks out sunlight they help keep your room cool as well as dark. This lining also adds an extra layer of insulation to the curtains, giving them the added benefit of being thermal. They protect against both heat loss and heat gain, regulating the temperature of your room so you’re kept warm in winter and cool in summer. These curtains can be hung with a pole or track using curtain hooks (not included). There are three hook positions on the heading, allowing you to choose how your curtains sit against the track or pole. For example, if you're using a track you may want to use the middle or lower row of hooks to cover the track, whereas if you're using a pole you may want to use the top row of hooks so the curtains hang below the rings. The specified drop is taken from the top row of hook pockets to the bottom edge of the curtain. The width stated indicates the size of one curtain panel when laid completely flat. This pack contains two panels, and the track/pole length we've recommended allows for the two panels to be gathered when the curtains are drawn. For a fuller look, increase the curtain width. We package our curtains in recycled materials to keep them protected whilst they make their way to you. When they arrive they may be creased. We recommend you follow the ironing instructions on the back of the packaging prior to hanging your curtains. Be aware that each style of curtain has different ironing instructions, including heat limitations according to the fabric, so do make sure you follow the guidance provided to get the best results. Do you need a curtain pole and accessories? These products are special because we negotiate exclusive discounts with our suppliers and pass the savings on to you. They're limited, either in quantity or for a period of time, but they'll always give you excellent quality at an exceptional price.

Plus the leakproof flip-top lid allows the straw to be easily and hygienically stored away, ideal for on the go. Suitable for cold or room temperature drinks only - if milk comes up the straw, this will be due to a build up of vapour pressure, either from warm drinks or from changing temperature, e.g. fridge cold milk in a warm room. Release the pressure by twisting the lid to allow it to escape before flipping the lid. Hand wash with mild detergent. Drip or Wipe Dry. For a light clean (e.g. if only used for water) the straw does not need to be removed from the lid. Wash with warm soapy water and simply run the straw under the tap, letting the water flow through the straw as you rub it between your fingers to remove any debris. Alternatively, fill the cup with hot soapy water. Close the lid and shake the cup. When you open it, the water will shoot out of the straw, giving it a 'pressure clean'. For a deeper clean (e.g. if used for milk or juice) detach the straw from the lid and give the cup a more thorough clean, leaving the straw to soak if necessary. The straw can then be cleaned with the TUM TUM straw brush or similar.

Plus the leakproof flip-top lid allows the straw to be easily and hygienically stored away, ideal for on the go. Suitable for cold or room temperature drinks only - if milk comes up the straw, this will be due to a build up of vapour pressure, either from warm drinks or from changing temperature, e.g. fridge cold milk in a warm room. Release the pressure by twisting the lid to allow it to escape before flipping the lid. Hand wash with mild detergent. Drip or Wipe Dry. For a light clean (e.g. if only used for water) the straw does not need to be removed from the lid. Wash with warm soapy water and simply run the straw under the tap, letting the water flow through the straw as you rub it between your fingers to remove any debris. Alternatively, fill the cup with hot soapy water. Close the lid and shake the cup. When you open it, the water will shoot out of the straw, giving it a 'pressure clean'. For a deeper clean (e.g. if used for milk or juice) detach the straw from the lid and give the cup a more thorough clean, leaving the straw to soak if necessary. The straw can then be cleaned with the TUM TUM straw brush or similar. Tippy Up Cups can also be sterilised by boiling, steaming, UV or chemical sterilisation.",[''],"['Product code:', '31318534']",2025-09-11 15:37:12.999
