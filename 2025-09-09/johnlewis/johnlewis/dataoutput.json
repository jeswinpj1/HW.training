The Super Restorative range is ideal for all women experiencing the effects of hormonal changes associated with menopause and has been formulated to support the skin during this stage of a woman's life. The skin is a hormone-dependent organ and the changes in hormones during peri and the start of post-menopause result in the skin becoming unbalanced. This disruption means that the skin struggles to protect itself during the day as well as reactivate itself at night. This can result in signs of ageing becoming more visible. The nourishing and revitalising formulas of Super Restorative help to fight visible changes on the skin which include dryness, skin slackening, loss of density, deep-set wrinkles, and an uneven skin tone. New research has led to Clarins\u2019 discovery of organic harungana which has intensive replenishment and anti-ageing benefits and offers the same effect as retinol whilst being tolerated by all skin types. Organic harungana is combined with our new plant discovery, organic gorse extract, which helps improve the tone of fibroblasts by up to 89% and provides a firmer, more toned skin alongside other ingredients such as organic desert date extract, organic sea lily and vitamin C derivative. Each of the Super Restorative Day & Night creams is formulated to adapt to the skin\u2019s chronobiology. During the day, the skin is vulnerable and needs protection and the squalane extract found in our day formulas reinforces the hydrolipidic film and protects the skin. At night, the skin needs reactivating as microcirculation slows. Organic service tree bud extract helps to stimulate the skin's microcirculation and boosts radiance. This innovative day and night duo ensure the skin's specific needs are met around the clock. The Night Cream for All Skin Types boosts the skin\u2019s radiance thanks to the service tree bud extract.", "unique_id": "Product code: ", "brand": null, "color": null},
