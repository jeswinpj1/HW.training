The Super Restorative range is ideal for all women experiencing the effects of hormonal changes associated with menopause and has been formulated to support the skin during this stage of a woman's life. The skin is a hormone-dependent organ and the changes in hormones during peri and the start of post-menopause result in the skin becoming unbalanced. This disruption means that the skin struggles to protect itself during the day as well as reactivate itself at night. This can result in signs of ageing becoming more visible. The nourishing and revitalising formulas of Super Restorative help to fight visible changes on the skin which include dryness, skin slackening, loss of density, deep-set wrinkles, and an uneven skin tone. New research has led to Clarins\u2019 discovery of organic harungana which has intensive replenishment and anti-ageing benefits and offers the same effect as retinol whilst being tolerated by all skin types. Organic harungana is combined with our new plant discovery, organic gorse extract, which helps improve the tone of fibroblasts by up to 89% and provides a firmer, more toned skin alongside other ingredients such as organic desert date extract, organic sea lily and vitamin C derivative. Each of the Super Restorative Day & Night creams is formulated to adapt to the skin\u2019s chronobiology. During the day, the skin is vulnerable and needs protection and the squalane extract found in our day formulas reinforces the hydrolipidic film and protects the skin. At night, the skin needs reactivating as microcirculation slows. Organic service tree bud extract helps to stimulate the skin's microcirculation and boosts radiance. This innovative day and night duo ensure the skin's specific needs are met around the clock. The Night Cream for All Skin Types boosts the skin\u2019s radiance thanks to the service tree bud extract.", "unique_id": ["Product code: ", "46211914"], "brand": "Clarins", "color": ""},

Apple has kitted out the newest iteration of their flagship phone with their most advanced dual-camera system yet, along with a lightning-fast chip that makes browsing, gaming, and video calling a cinch.

Ultra-high pixel density means photos, videos and text look extra-sharp, and the display is even more expansive, thanks to a smaller TrueDepth camera area. Just about everything on the iPhone 13's camera has been upgraded. The new dual setup reveals more detail in the dark areas of your photos, along with image stabilisation tech that keeps shots steady even when you're not. Night Mode now features on the front-facing camera, meaning better selfies after sundown, and Photographic Styles apply your preferred Tone and Warmth settings to your photos automatically. When filming, capture cinema-style moments with the new Cinematic Mode that adjusts focus automatically as you record; even allowing you to edit the depth effect when the shoot's over.

The new edge-to-edge 4.1-inch Infinity Cover Screen not only looks incredible, but also comes with Galaxy AI[1] and Google Gemini[2]. Ask questions, set appointments and reminders, all before unfolding the handset to reveal the massive 6.9-inch screen. Now backed with 4,300mAh[3] of battery power.\nGet the ultra-selfie experience with 50MP rear camera and the Next Gen ProVisual Engine for the best shots any time of day. Edit your selfie with your custom filters straight from your Infinity FlexWindow and let the intuitive Galaxy AI features like Best Face[4] and Photo Assist[1] make your pictures social feed-worthy. Galaxy Z Flip7 is the thinnest, yet most durable, Galaxy Z Flip device to date.

The new build is super light and super slim, measuring just 6.5mm \u2013 about the same width as a pencil.

When it\u2019s time for a big group photo, Best Face[8] makes sure everyone always looks their best. It takes multiple pics of the same composition in a quick burst, so if someone has their eyes closed, you can instantly swap it to a better facial expression.

Using protective leather gels and/or sprays such as Collinil Leather Gel will help to improve the water resistance of certain leathers and can help leather resist dirt and moisture. Use whenever you feel the leather needs a bit of a refresh or a just little more shine. Try to keep leather away from water and out of heavy rainfall.

Well for starters, it's loved for its industrial aesthetic and strong welded iron details, which have a wire-brushed and distressed finish. But it's also loved for its natural charm. Individual slats of solid oak make up the rustic surfaces which have been thoughtfully chosen by skilled craftspeople. They ensure that the natural pattern of the wood grain, even with its unique irregularities, uphold the design and quality standards that we're known for. This ensures our Calia range offers a look that's as authentic as possible. Easy on the eye and great for smaller rooms. This dining table has space for four seats. It's incredibly sturdy and quick to assemble. Oak is a natural, living material, and part of its charm is that it develops over time. This means that surface splits may start to appear with the natural movement of the wood. Knots will vary in size and location and a subtle colour variation can also be expected. These distinctive qualities give the range a unique feel, as no two pieces will be exactly the same. To keep your furniture looking its best, we recommend periodic oiling and oiling before first use.

With each piece of furniture made from smooth pale oak, it's the beautifully curved shapes and spindles that characterise this range. Drawn from original 1950s designs, this dining table showcases exquisite craftsmanship and quality. It's built using the dovetail and box joint method for durability and it's been coated in a protective matt lacquer. It can seat up to eight people when it's fully extended and the butterfly extension leaves can be stored neatly inside the table when you don't need them. We like the soft-edge, gently curved finish of the surface and the spindle-shaped tapered legs for that cool Scandi edge. As wood is a natural material, every piece of ercol furniture has its own unique difference. You can expect varying grain patterns, colours and shading depending on how the original tree grew. Grain patterns also depend on how the wood is cut. When oak is cut across the grain for example, medullary rays occur which creates growth rings and flecks - this is a sign of quality.

They ensure that the natural pattern in the wood grain, even with its unique irregularities, uphold our design and quality standards, to offer an authentic and tactile look. This solid and sturdy dining table can be extended easily thanks to the extension leaves that are fixed to both ends. Providing seating for up to 12 diners at its full extension, it's supported by a robust, welded iron base that's finished with a durable lacquer. The extension leaves must be stored separately when not in use. Striking and functional in design, this table will sit well amongst industrial-inspired settings. Oak is a natural, living material, and part of its charm is that it develops over time. This means that surface splits may start to appear with the natural movement of the wood. Knots will vary in size and location and a subtle colour variation can also be expected. These distinctive qualities give the range a unique feel, as no two pieces will be exactly the same. To keep your furniture looking its best, we recommend periodic oiling and oiling before first use. This is applicable to the Oak version only, as the Dark version has a lacquered finish. More information can be found in the assembly instructions supplied. You may want to see and get a feel for the furniture in one of our shops before ordering.
